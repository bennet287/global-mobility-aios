# features/wiki_system/merge_behavior

[[features/wiki_system/_index|..]]

***

Sibling nodes evolve the same project wiki on parallel git branches (the merge
topology: [[architecture/worktrees]]), so `_index.md` files — whose generated
link blocks churn on every update — would conflict constantly under plain
three-way merging. The wiki ships a custom git merge driver for them, wired by
`.gitattributes` (`**/_index.md merge=wiki`) and registered in the repo-local
git config by `wiki init` and `wiki config`. Fractal commits the attribute in
the user node's baseline, so every branch in the tree merges indexes through the
driver.

## What the driver does

The driver splits an `_index.md` at the `***` separator. Above it, the
frontmatter merges field-aware: the regenerated keys and the generated link
block normalize to "ours" — `wiki update` owns them, so their churn must never
conflict — while authored keys (`title`, `desc`, `created`, `category`, `tags`,
`sources`) get a normal three-way merge that can conflict. On add/add merges
(both sides created the page) `created` joins the take-ours set, since both
stamps come from independent update runs. A side whose frontmatter is
undetectable is treated as unchanged from base, never as a deletion; a side that
dropped the `***` separator its base carried cannot be split into regions, so it
surfaces a whole-file conflict with a repair hint. Everything below `***` is
authored content and merges three-way, with a hint comment planted above add/add
body conflicts.

Because the link block takes ours, a merge drops the other branch's link rows —
by design: the next `wiki update` (which the fractal commit pipeline runs; see
[[features/wiki_system/index_regeneration]]) regenerates the block from the
merged filesystem, and a merged-in `title` shows in the H1 only after that
post-merge update.

## The parent's reconciliation job

Children link only to pages that existed when they wrote, so freshly merged
siblings leave stale cross-links behind. Index rows refresh mechanically at
commit, but prose links do not: after integrating children, the parent runs
`wiki lint` and repairs or prunes what it reports — now-resolvable links become
wikilinks, still-dangling ones stay plain text — and refreshes any navigation
tables it authored, which lint cannot see.
