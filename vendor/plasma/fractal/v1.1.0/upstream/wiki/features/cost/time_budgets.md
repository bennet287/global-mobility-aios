***

Time budgets bound wall-clock the way [[features/cost/budgets|budgets]] bound
dollars: three configurable timeout tiers — the whole-run `timeout`, the
per-iteration `iter_timeout`, and the per-step `step_timeout` — each read from
node config and enforced by the loop. All are optional; an unset tier simply has
no deadline.

## Tiers and defaults

- **Run** — the `timeout` config key caps the whole run, anchored on the run's
  start instant.
- **Iteration** — `iter_timeout` caps each iteration. When it is unset but
  `interval` is configured, the interval becomes the per-iteration deadline: an
  interval-driven loop bounds each iteration to its slot. An explicit
  `iter_timeout` tighter than the interval is honored; one looser than the
  interval is rejected at the config boundary rather than silently loosened.
- **Step** — `step_timeout` caps each step. A step definition can carry its own
  `timeout:` frontmatter override, so one long step (a slow test suite) can
  exceed the node-wide per-step limit without loosening it for the rest.

`interval` and `sleep` pacing are mutually exclusive; only `interval` doubles as
an iteration deadline.

## Reading remaining time

`fractal node time remaining [node] [--scope=run|iter|step]` prints the whole
seconds left before a timeout fires. With no `--scope` it reports the soonest of
the configured deadlines — the time until the *next* timeout, whichever tier it
comes from. The command answers for any node, not just the running one: each
deadline is derived from the configured limit plus the persisted start instant
of the scope's active row (the open run row, the active iteration row, or the
active step row), mirroring how cost remaining is read from persisted state. Two
sentinel outputs replace the countdown: `no limit` when the queried scope(s)
have no timeout configured, and `not running` when a limit exists but no run,
iteration, or step is currently active to anchor it. The countdown clamps at
zero — an overrun deadline reads `0s`, never negative.

## Pause credit-back

Pausing a node parks the loop while leaving the run row (and any open iteration)
open for a later resume to adopt. Raw wall-clock elapsed since the row's start
would therefore charge the entire frozen span against the run and iteration
deadlines — a node paused overnight would wake already timed out. Instead,
deadline accounting credits paused spans back: the pause and resume events
recorded on the run carry point-in-time instants, and the elapsed time used
against a deadline subtracts every pause→resume span (clipped to the scope's
anchor, so an iteration deadline credits only the frozen time inside that
iteration). A trailing pause with no resume yet accrues credit up to the present
— a still-parked node's clock stays stopped.

Edge semantics follow the event log's meaning: a failed resume never relaunched
the loop, so only a completed resume closes a span, while even a failed pause
opens one (its signal is durable and the loop parks regardless); duplicate
pauses collapse onto the first and duplicate resumes are inert. Steps need no
credit-back at all — a step never spans a pause, because the interrupted step
row closes as paused and resume opens a fresh step row with a fresh deadline.

## Interaction with cost budgets

Time and cost budgets are independent guards on the same loop: an iteration ends
at whichever boundary arrives first, and the loop's banner reports both the
timeout configuration and the cost caps. Time budgets have no reserve tier —
wind-down under the cost reserve is described in
[[features/cost/budgets|budgets]].
