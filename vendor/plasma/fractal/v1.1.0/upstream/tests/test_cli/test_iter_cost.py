"""Per-iteration cost cap (``max_iter_cost``) enforcement in the run loop.

The loop parses, stores, reads, and *displays* ``--max-iter-cost``
-- but it must also **enforce** it: when an iteration's accrued spend reaches the
cap, the remaining steps are steered to ``RESERVE.md`` (the same soft-cap
steering the cumulative ``max_cost`` drain already applies), never auto-stopping.

The loop's budget logic is observable only through a real launch, so this
drives the real ``fractal node _loop`` as a subprocess against a real
node with a **stubbed ``claude``** -- the smallest hermetic harness: one
iteration, two steps, no real API calls and no recursion. The stub captures each
step's prompt and emits a ``stream-json`` ``result`` event carrying a fixed cost
so the loop's stream driver records the step's spend, exactly as a real run
would.

The observable effect of the cap is that the step *after* the cap is hit
receives ``RESERVE.md`` appended to its prompt. Step 1 always runs before any
spend is recorded, so it is never steered; step 2 is steered iff the iteration's
accrued spend reached the cap.
