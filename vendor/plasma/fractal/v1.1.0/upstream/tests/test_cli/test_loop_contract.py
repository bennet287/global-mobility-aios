"""The loop's grep-anchored stdout contract.

A handful of ``fractal/core/loop.py`` stdout lines are load-bearing
beyond logging: the e2e harness (``test_run_modes``) and operators
watching a pane grep them to observe the loop's state from outside.
Renaming one silently breaks every consumer, so this module is the
single inventory of lines any implementation of the loop must emit
verbatim, each mapped to its consumers.

The division of labor: the e2e suite pins that each line is actually
*emitted* on its trigger (drains, budgets, parks, adoption); this module
pins the *inventory* -- the anchors exist verbatim in the loop source,
so an edit that would strand the consumers fails here by name. The
anchors are deliberately restated as literals rather than imported from
their consumers: the contract must not move when a consumer's constant
does.

Only loop-produced lines belong here: confirmations printed by
``fractal`` CLI commands (pause/resume summaries, ``pause.sh``'s abort
notice) are pinned by their own command and e2e tests, and mode-doc
markers by the prompt tests.
